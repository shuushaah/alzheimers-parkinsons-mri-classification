# Alzheimer's & Parkinson's Disease Classification from MRI Images

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning and deep learning pipeline for **Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease classification using MRI images**.  
It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, traditional machine learning (KNN), and deep learning models (CNN, MobileNet) with evaluation metrics.  
The project showcases the application of ML/DL techniques on real-world medical image datasets and achieves competitive predictive accuracy.

## Techniques Used
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- SMOTE for class balancing
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- MobileNet Transfer Learning
- Train/Test split and model evaluation

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- Scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
- NumPy, Matplotlib, PIL

## Dataset
- MRI images organized in folders by class
- Separate training and testing sets
- Each class folder contains multiple MRI images used for classification

## Results
- KNN Accuracy: **90%**  
- CNN Accuracy: **74%**  
- MobileNet Accuracy: **77.85%**
